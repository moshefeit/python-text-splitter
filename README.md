# python-text-splitter

Python script to split a really big text file to multiple files by lines. If you need to upload a dataset that is so big in size, why don't you just split it into multiple files and join them later in the cloud?

This script are built with **Python 2.7**, on **Windows** environment, on **.TXT** file. Other than that, haven't been tested yet.

Just download or copy the code from `Main.py`. And open up command prompt:

1. `cd path/to/main.py`
2. python main.py

You need only the **complete path** of the file, and this script will do the job.
